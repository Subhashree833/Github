🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a house based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location factors, and other relevant attributes.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

📊 Visualization

A correlation heatmap was used to understand the relationship between features and house price.

Distribution plots helped analyze the spread of house prices.

Scatter plots (Area vs Price, Bedrooms vs Price) showed that larger area and more bedrooms generally increase the price.

📌 Conclusion

The machine learning model successfully predicts house prices based on input features. Area and number of bedrooms are major factors affecting price. The model shows good performance based on evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.
