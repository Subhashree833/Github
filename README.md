🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

________________________________________

📌 Problem Statement
This project aims to build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking. The objective is to train the model on historical data and accurately estimate the target variable (Price).

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains housing information required to predict house prices.

Each record represents a house with the following features:

•	Area 

•	Bedrooms 

•	Bathrooms

•	Stories 

•	Parking 

•	Price (Target Variable)

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

•	R² Score
________________________________________
📊 Visualization
•	A correlation heatmap was used to understand the relationship between features and house price.
•	Distribution plots helped analyze the spread of house prices.
•	Scatter plots (Area vs Price, Bedrooms vs Price) showed that larger area and more bedrooms generally increase the price.

📌 Conclusion
The machine learning model successfully predicts house prices based on input features. Area and number of bedrooms are major factors affecting price. The model shows good performance based on evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.
